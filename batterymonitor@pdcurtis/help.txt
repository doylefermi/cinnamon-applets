This is a simple applet I have written for my laptop because I have recently had a couple of times where I have missed the warnings about low battery. The latest version of Cinnamon seems to have lost the setting to specify the action when the battery is critical and I had full shutdown losing several minutes work. In any case there is no easy way to set the 'shutdown' level.

This applet allows one to set a level at which the machine starts to shutdown (suspend as currently set up) with plenty of warning. 

The applet normally shows the percentage charge on a coloured background which is: 

   Green when above a warning level (set currently to twice the 'shutdown' level.)
   Orange between the warning and shutdown level
   Red and flashing at and below the Shutdown level (even when charging).

When the battery is Discharging the warning and shutdown regions have a much larger flashing orange or red message in the applet which is difficult to miss. When the shutdown level is reached an alert is put up with options of an immediate suspend or cancel - if nothing is done it suspends 30 seconds latter. If cancelled (or the machine is turned back on without the battery being on charge) the alert and shutdown sequence is restarted after the battery has dropped another 1%. 

The intention is to allow the possibility of leaving suspend with enough battery to close programs and shut down after powering up from suspend without a charger after an accidental unattended suspend. It is suggested that the 'shutdown level' is set to about 10% to allow time. Do not forget that the battery still drains although slowly during suspend.

The applet draws on my code for the NUMA (Network Utilisation Monitoring and Alert) Applet but is much less configurable.

The Applet should work with Mint 17 and higher and Cinnamon 2.0 and higher but currently most of the testing has been with Mint 18. It is currently offered a a beta (development) level.
