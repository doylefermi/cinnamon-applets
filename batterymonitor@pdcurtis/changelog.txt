          batteryPercentage divided by 4 to allow testing
          Display only Version without call to SuspendScript
          Beautified
v30_1.0.1 Code added to ensure valid readings of batteryPercentage
          Code added to 'flash' messages  and extend width with messages but only when discharging.
          Code added to call Suspend script but only when percentage has fallen 
             ie it will be called every 1% fall so it is re-enabled after returning from suspend
          Suspendscript active
          TEST CODE STILL IN PLACE so levels incorrect
v30_1.0.2 Some changes in how test appplied to make it easier to take them out
          Extra flag added for flashing
          Tests look good and suspendscript works.
          TEST CODE STILL IN PLACE
          Should I add a forced shutdown if level drops to say 5% because taken out of suspend with 
          level dropped too far or suspend cancelled too many times?
