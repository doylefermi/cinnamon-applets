Version v18_1.1.1
0.9.0 Release Candidate 30-07-2013
0.9.1 Help file facility added and link to gnome-system-monitor
0.9.2 Change Hold to Pause in Tooltip
0.9.3 Beautified at http://jsbeautifier.org/ and a few more comments 14-08-2013
0.9.4 Major improvement - only run updateLoop() when counter running to save processor
      This is important if you have multiple instances as each would consume processor 
      even when not running.
0.9.5 Added a Checkbox to Settings giving option to continue counting from paused. 
      Normal sequence on clicking is 'start -> pause -> reset' 
      In optional mode this changes to 'start -> pause -> continue -> pause etc'.
      In this mode one has to use th Right Click (Context) Menu to reset. 15-08-2013
0.9.6 Refinement of Tooltip text. 15-08-2013
0.9.6 Removed Simple from Title. Custom Icon in folder and icon line removed from metadata.json
      (alternative is line "icon": "appointment-new") and follow theme 17-08-2013
0.9.7 Major change to single counterStatus from a series of flags
0.9.8 counterStatus, currentCount and startTime are now stored as Settings variables
      so the counter is not reset by a cinnamon reset.
0.9.9 New variable pauseAt added and replaces currentCount in Settings to reduce the load on Settings 
      as it is updated only at time of counter being paused.
      Changed to call a null function when a generic setting changed rather than a UI update. 25-08-2013
