cinnamon-applets
================

A family of Applets written by pdcurtis. They have a common theme of real time monitoring, control and limiting the usage of scarce or expensive resources: data, power and time. Currently there are 5 applets in separate folders in the repository.

 - NUMA - Network Usage Monitor with Alerts. The first and most powerful applet. 

 - Stopwatch - A simple stopwatch applet with multiple instances allowed.

 - Bumblebee - an Applet to select the Graphics Processor (Intel Integrated or nVidia Discrete GPU) using Bumblebee for procesors with Optimus technology. Displays the nVidia GPU temperature when in use. 

 - NVP - Nvidia Prime. Select Graphics Processors using nVidia Prime, the prefered solution replacing Bumblebee. Displays the nVidia GPU temperature when it is in use.

 - BAMS - Battery Applet with Monitoring and Shutdown. This is the latest applet I have written for my laptop to replace features lost from Cinnamon 3.0 which seems to have lost the  setting to specify the action when the battery is critical. Moreover there is no easy way to set the 'shutdown' level in Mint 18 Sarah/Cinnamon 3.0 leading to potential permanent reduction of the capacity of Lithium Ion batteries as they can end up completely discharged.

All these applets are a family with a common 'style' with coloured backgrounds indicating the status and highly visible or audible notifications of alerts. They are all user configurable with a similar settings interfaces and  sliders to set alert levels from a left click menu where appropriate. They are all designed to work with light and dark styles and can also be optimised by the user by editing a very simple style sheet.

There is a more comprehensive description of these applets on my web site at http:// www.pcurtis.com/spices.htm
