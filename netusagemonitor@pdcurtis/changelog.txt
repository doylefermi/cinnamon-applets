2.2.0 Start of implementing some form of response to exceeding data limits - termed crisis management
2.2.1 Crisis Management flag and 'terminal command' to be run now in Settings Panel.
2.2.2 Facility for two preset scripts in addition to string added. Right click menu has additional housekeeping functions to edit and test these scripts added.  
2.2.3 Addition documentation
2.2.4 Changed 'crisis' to 'suspend' for preset script and tested. Reorder advanced functions and added separators.
2.2.5 Three special cases now in use - suspendscript, alertscript and modalalert. Function added to implement the modal dialog used by modal alert. Testing functions still 'exposed' to users on right click function submenu. 
To think about - do we need the ability to have a terminal command option as any terminal command can be put into the alertScript file, in fact it can be a series of commands run asyncronously by ending them with a $ so a sound file could be played and a notification put up using zenity at the same time. This is a safer way ahead whilst leaving a huge flexibility for customisation. Should a different selection mechanism be used? 
Conclusion - change to a drop down selection of options, initially the three currently in use but consider adding sound and notification options. remove terminal string option as it can be in a script file.
2.2.6 Implemented drop down alert handling plus change back to KB from kB and replace round with floor
2.2.7 Scripts commented and checked. Extra options of notify and do nothing added. Use now made of Sox to play audio warnings and notify-send to add notifications. sox needs to be installed

2.3.4 Addition of radiused borders to background to improve appearance
2.3.5 Major change in use of css styles for the background colours which show connection and alert status.
