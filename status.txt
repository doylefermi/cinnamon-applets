At present the git repository has the version uploaded to the website last September.

The next step is to add each of the versions which have been recently uploaded as a series of commits. The whole list is:

v18_1.0 Release Candidate of original version for Cinnamon 1.8

v18_2.3.2 Release Candidate of enhanced version (Cinnamon 1.8)

v18_2.3.3 Quick fix to improve appearance with light themes

v18_2.3.6 Background colours can be configured in the stylesheet and default has radiused corners - Click for a screenshot on a light theme (Void).

v18_2.3.7 Corrected inconsistency in handling of Cumulative totals


v20_2.3.15 Consistent handling of context menu between Cinnamon 1.8 and 2.0. Simplified use of cumulative totals including a new reset function and display of reset date and time. Fixes to avoid anomalies when running under Mint 16. (3 March 2014)

v20_2.3.17  Minor enhancements and improvements in consistency with Cinnamon 2.0  - see change log for more details (20 March 2014)

v20_2.4.2  Will, by default, automatically select active interface from those managed by the Network Manager, whilst retaining options for more sophiscated use and Point to Point Protocol (ppp) connections - see change log for more details (6 May 2014)

Full log from 2.3.7 -> 2.4.2

2.3.8  Anomoly fix - Avoid calling  GTop.glibtop_get_netload() without valid interface -
       possible latest versions can segfault if interface not valid.
2.3.9  Add fix for Applet not being fully halted when removed from panel (from dansie)
2.3.10 Fudge to make NUMA behave the same for Cinnamon 1.8 and 2.0 by removing the
       automatically added items from the context menu by calling rebuilding menu a second 
       time during startup sequence after a one cycle delay. Long term solution is to use 
       dansie's method of building everything as a submenu. 
2.3.11 Default settings changed to start with cummulative monitoring off for all interfaces
       (null) in settings file.
2.3.12 Revert to the old method of handling cumulative data and only update cumulative totals
       for the monitored interface. Slightly less flexible but intended to reduce the chances
       of segfaults until the problem is understood and resolved.
2.3.13 Changes to Settings File to explicitely use real numbers for Cumulative Data
2.3.14 Test of reset function including setting reset date and time 
       and avoid use of updating a Cinnamon Settings within a single expression
       NB Interface 1 only 
       TEST at 10x speed - remember to reset!!!
2.3.15 Now reset function on all 3 interfaces which also avoids use of updating a Cinnamon Settings
       within a single expression on all interfaces.
       Display simplified in left click menu to format of: interface - reset date and time - Cumulative data
       ie now a single line for each interface.
       Settings file changed to use generic bidirectional where interfaces are set from applet and defaults changed
       Reset to run at correct speed 
       UPLOADED VERSION 10 March 2014.
2.3.16 Try delaying cumulative updates into cinnamon-settings by using two mainloop timers.
       Bug fix for when no default interface specified and default unchecked in settings.
       Some default settings changed in settings-schema
2.3.17 Some changes so cinnamon-settings values of cumulative total are only updated when changed in second part of loop
       Added interface name to reset menu item and rebuildFlag to on_interface_settings_changed()
       Changed 'Settings' to 'Configure' in Context Menu for consistency with Cinnamon 2.0
2.4.0  Changes to automatically select first active interface at start-up But Only If a default interface was not specified 
       and the last interface was not PPP0.
       Added explanatory text to settings-schema.json comment for the useDefaultInterface flag
2.4.1  Moved Configure to bottom of context menu
       Tried multiple instances - useful but automatic update fails and hand crafting of .cinnamon/configs/netusagemonitor@pdcurtis required
       Checked with Cinnamon 2.2 via LiveUSB
2.4.2  Display of Header inhibited when no Cummulative Data being displayed.


All of the intermediate versions have been added to git except 2.4.0 and 2.4.1 which had trivial test changes and should never have had separate version numbers.
